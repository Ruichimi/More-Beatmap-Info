# Note about data processing in the class /src/js/Services/MoreBeatmapInfo:

There are cases when the map block in the DOM is loaded before the tracking starts,
and at the same time, the lower blocks on the page may still be loaded by scrolling
down as new blocks that we are tracking. In this case, the code to retrieve information will run twice.
The initially loaded block may no longer have a reference in the DOM and will
become useless due to the mechanics of JavaScript or the osu website.

The issue can arise if these blocks are passed during a server request for data, and the previous
code interrupts it with the mechanism that blocks repeated requests in the project.
This means the reprocessing will fail, and the first one will not have a reference to the DOM element.

To prevent this, we set the id in the mapset block in setInfoToBeatmapBlocks method,
before making the server request. In the processBeatmapBlock method, we check if the block
still has a reference in the DOM using the contains method.
If not, we get the updated block via the id.
This way, the first processing will succeed even if the reference to the DOM is lost.
